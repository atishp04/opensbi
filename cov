The latest version of the SBI specification includes a Performance Monitoring
Unit(PMU) extension[1] which allows the supervisor to start/stop/configure
various PMU events. This series implements the SBI PMU extension in OpenSBI.

It doesn't implement the bits required to support "Sscof" extension yet. That
will be added later along with qemu support. This series can be found at github[4]
as well. It has been tested with Linux kernel patches[3] for different
hardware/firmware events on Qemu.

This patch requires basic QEMU support series[2] to work. As the Qemu did not
support mhpmevent/mhpmcounter before this series, these changes are not backward
compatible to avoid code churn. Anybody who wants to use perf must include
Qemu, OpenSBI, Linux kernel patches.
